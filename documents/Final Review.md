Review your initial game design document. Compare and contrast the game you had initially planned and your final outcome. 

After comparing and contrasting my game design document to my final game, I have found that my game ended up not having as much of a storyline and being a bit more simple than I planned. I think this is because I ran into lots of little problems along the way and ended up having time constraints that limited what more I could add. I did stick to my plan of having themes of climate change and though it was more simple, stuck to my plotline. I originally planned to have more backstory to my game but as it wasn't completely vital to the game I ended up focusing on other aspects so I could get a completed game within the time frame.

Given each of the initial success criteria that you determined when designing your project, was your game a success? Why or why not? 

When looking at my original success criteria, my final game can be considered a success. It checks all of the criteria that I originally had. My game can be installed, understood and completed. I have determined this through final user testing all going successfully. I asked people who played my final game whether they understood the themes and everyone said they understood them however they could have been more obvious. The users also enjoyed playing the game so I would call my final game a success.


Describe the testing process you undertook to ensure your game functioned as intended. 

As I coded my game, I tested every aspect as I went. For example as I created the code for my enemies I would test it after I added something new to make sure it was working. I would fix problems as they popped up and improve my game. As well as this, at the end of every sprint I would do end user testing. This would help me to discover and sort out issues or things that could be improved. For example if the levels were too difficult my end users were able to tell me and I could make changes to make my game function as intended

Describe your trialling process, and the impact that it had on the development of your outcome. 

I ran A/B trials every sprint to find out which of two options people preferred in my game. The trials I ran made a big difference to the development and outcome of my game. As I progressed, I would consistently run trials on different aspects of my game. For example the art and aesthetics or the movement and speeds of my sprites. this effected my development because along the way I was constantly changing and advancing my game based on the information I got from my trials. This effected my final outcome as the feedback I got changed how my game looked and functioned.

Discuss in detail how testing and trialling the components of your game lead to the development of a high quality task. 

The testing and trialling that I ran every sprint led to a higher quality game because I was able to figure out what end users wanted to see out of my game and change it to meet what they preferred. For example, the physics engines that I A/B tested effected my outcome and improved it, resulting in a higher quality task. With my testing, I was able to develop my game to a higher quality. An example of this is the testing of my enemy, through my testing I was able to narrow down the problems with my enemies functions and make them work. this led to my game being of higher quality because this was necessary to the completion of my game.

Given the opportunity to develop this game again, what parts of the *process* would you change and why?

If I had the opportunity to develop my game again, one of the parts of the process I would change is my time management. I didn't make enough progress on my game in the earlier sprints because of how I managed my time and some of the problems I ran into so I was unfortunately not able to get as many components into my game as I had hoped. If I developed it again and were to manage my time better, I would improve my storyline to make my games themes stand out more and so the player could connect to the audience more with its backstory.
