**Final Testing**

Please describe how you know your final game works

> I know my final game works because it opens and runs through the whole game when I click start. There are no bugs and it can be opened on other computers with no glitches or crashes. The user is able to play through the whole game with no issues.

**Authenticity Statement**

Other than using tutorials and example code, all this work is my own. I understand all of the code and can explain it. Every commit made from my account was made by me.
