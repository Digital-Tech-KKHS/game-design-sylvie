# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**


In this sprint I worked on mainly my art and enemies.  I have been learning the best ways to implement enemies into my game and have changed it so they are an object in my tile map that switches to my enemy character once the code for it has run. I am in the process of getting my seek function on my enemies to work. I have the code in my game but it is currently not working. this will be something for me to continue working on over the holidays before school starts again. I worked a lot on the art for my game, I improved my map a lot, putting in actual buildings and the icon for money in the corner. I have implemented this into my game. 

Unfortunately I missed quite a few lessons this sprint because of teacher strikes and a few days where I couldn't be at school so didn't get quite as much done as I planned to. over the holidays I'm going to continue improving and working on my game so I can get it as complete as possible before exam study.
