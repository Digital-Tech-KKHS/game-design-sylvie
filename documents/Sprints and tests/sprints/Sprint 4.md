# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**


In this sprint I worked on mainly my art and enemies.  I have been learning the best ways to implement enemies into my game and I am now in the process of getting my seek function on my enemies to work. I have the code in my game but it is currently not working. This will be something for me to continue working on over the holidays before school starts again. I worked hard on the art for my game, I improved my map a lot, putting in actual buildings and the icon for money in the corner. I have implemented this into my game. I have been focusing much more on the code in my game for the last few sprints so had a big focus on art this time.

Unfortunately I missed quite a few lessons this sprint because of teacher strikes and a few days where I couldn't be at school so didn't get quite as much done as I planned to. Over the holidays I'm going to continue improving and working on my game so I can get it as complete as possible before school starts again.
