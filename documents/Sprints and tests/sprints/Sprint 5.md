# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**


As this was the final sprint, I got a lot of work done, tying up all the lose ends of my code and finally finishing my map. It was an extremely productive sprint because I realised I still had a fair bit of my game to do. I completed each of my levels and incorporated my NPC into my game. A lot of code went into my NPC as it had to have different dialogue on every level and at different times. I had dialogue index's on my first level so the dialogue moved along on mouse press. On other levels in was on colliding and dependant on scores etc. The dialogue was very important for the understanding of the game so implementing it was vital. Because of time constraints I changed my enemy design to a police drone instead of a character because I did not have the time to do the animation or physics for it. I changed it to a police drone instead. I actually felt that this was a better option than having a police officer because as this is set in the future the use of a drone could actually make more sense. I completed my maps. As I have the same map for each level, this wasn't too difficult, however, the art was quite time consuming. Another aspect of the art that I did was the collectable items and the icons in the corner of the screen. This was quite easy and incorporating it into the code was fairly simple as well but it was very important as it determined whether you would/wouldn't pass the level. I put my characters animation in the game, this was fairly simple as I coded it before, it was just drawing the animation which took a while. 

I realised I had a lot more to do than I thought in this sprint so I really pushed to get everything completed. this unfortunately means I had to skip out on a few of the features I was hoping to incorporate. I am still happy with how my game turned out though because I have learnt a lot this year and put all of it towards my game. it has most of the storyline that I originally wanted and I am pleased with the outcome.


## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Finishing game
- NPC's
- Dialogue
- Maps
- Character animation
- Completing levels
- Interactable items

## **Brief Description of your testing**
- I ran A/B testing to decide whether or not my enemy was too fast. I thought that maybe their speed was making the game too difficult and after testing on end users they confirmed this.
- I tested my dialogue for my NPC. I originally found that something about it I didn't like was that it kept repeating itself. so I added a function that meant dialogue was inactive after the index reached a certain point.
- I tested my enemy seek function. I got it right this time and it worked as expected.  got end users to test it and tell which distance they would like the enemy to seek player from.
