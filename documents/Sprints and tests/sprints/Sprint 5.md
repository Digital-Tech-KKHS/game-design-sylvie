# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**


As this was the final sprint, I got a lot of work done, tying up all the lose ends of my code and finally finishing my map. It was an extremely productive sprint because I realised I still had a fair bit of my game to do. I completed each of my levels and incorporated my NPC into my game. becasue of time constraints i changed my enemy design to a police drone instead of a character because i did not have the time to do the animation or physics for it. 

I realised I had a lot more to do than I thought so this sprint i really pushed to get everything completed. this unfortunately means i had to skip out on a few of the features i was hoping to incorporate.
