# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**
During this sprint I started my game. I put in all the basic code to create a window, character and the beginnings of a map. I did a lot of messing round with my map in this sprint, in my previous game I made it 2d so it took a bit of getting used to having it from a top down POV. I did not have my tile size right on the map so at the end of this sprint my game looked very disjointed as I hadn't quite finished the final parts of the map. 

I am very happy with the progress that I made during this sprint. Last year doing this sort of work was really hard and I was really happy to find that I was able to understand and do it much faster this year.

## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
The major achievements I made in this sprint were getting my game running with the starts of an MVP. I did a lot of testing learning about how top down worked compared to 2d. I found the controls to be quite different but I was able to get it working and am currently in the process of improving them to a movement I like more. the A/B testing I did also gave me a direction to work towards in my game.

As well as this, I created a basic map and character stand in, successfully implementing them both into my game. 

## **Brief Description of your testing**
I did A/B testing on which  game design people like more: top down or 2d. I created 2 different maps and asked people from inside and outside our class which they preferred the look of.

I tested the controls of my game. I had them setup the same way as I did for my 2d game I realised this didn't work and changed them to suit top down.

I tested my game and found that my physics engine was making my character fall off the map as I had gravity on. As I don't have walls etc in my game at the moment, I removed it, fixing the issue.
