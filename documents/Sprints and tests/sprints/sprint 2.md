# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**

During this sprint I ran into a few issue with my code while trying to get new features working. I got my pymunk physics engine functioning which will help me a lot with character movement in the future. Using this physics engine I got walls working which are very important for my top down map. Learning how to do this took longer than expected so I ended up not having as much time for other features I was hoping to work on. 

I fixed the tile size of my map so it looked a lot better in this sprint. I worked on my tile set and I finished my character design, implementing the character into my game. After completing both of these I began working on code for enemies. They are an important part of my game because they determine whether you win or lose. I wasn't able to finish this as I got stuck with a few issues so I'm hoping I will complete it in the next sprint.


## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- Start screen 
- Map tiles
- Walls/physics engine
- Getting character into game
- Starting on enemies
## **Brief Description of your testing**
I asked a few people to give opinions on my damping for the physics engine. I thought it looks like its drifting too much so I changed this after feedback that agreed with me.

I did A/B testing to get opinions on colour schemes that would best suit my game.

During the week I ran some tests on movement and controls and found a few issues so the testing included how I fixed one of them.
