# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**

during this sprint i ran into a few issue with my code while trying to get new features working. i got my pymunk physics engine functioning which will help me a lot with character movement in the future. using this physics engine i got walls working which are very important for my topdown map. learning how to do this took longer than expected so didnt have as much time for other features

i worked on my tileset and i finished my character design, implementing the character into my game. after completeing both of these i began working on code for enemies. they are an important part of my mvp because they determine wether you win or lose. i wasnt able to finish this as i got stuck with a few issues so will complete it in the next sprint.


## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**

## **Brief Description of your testing**
i asked a few people to give opinons on my damping for the physics engine. i thought it looks like its drifting too much so i did an A/B test on 0.5 against 0.1 damping.

opinions on colour schemes that would best portray themes of the game. 

character speed, people test playing my game to see which is preferred.
