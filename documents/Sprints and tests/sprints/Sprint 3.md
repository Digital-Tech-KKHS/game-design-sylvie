# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**

enemies
win/lose function
worked on tilesets for map
animation for character
pymunk physics engine removed(movement)

in this sprint i worked on both my code and art. after getting others to test my game and using it more, i decided to chagne my physics engine back from the pymunk physics engine. i did this because i was not happy with the way my character was moving and decided i didnt need a physics engine this complex. i worked prety hard during this sprint but i think i couldve progressed more. i changed how i implemented my enemies as i previously had them as an object on the tilemap but decided that wasnt good enough so have put them in through vs code the same way i would my player. 

i worked on my tilesets for my game and finished my enemy character design. next sprint i will get my map looking better as i think thats where my game is lacking most at the moment.

## **Brief Description of your testing**
I tested which movement people liked more for each physics engine. this was done through an A/B test and letting people have a go playing with each.
