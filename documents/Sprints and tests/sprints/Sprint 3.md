# Sprint Summary
## **Sprint Reflection and summary**

In this sprint I worked on both my code and art. After getting others to test my game and using it more, I decided to change my physics engine back from the pymunk physics engine. I did this because I was not happy with the way my character was moving and decided I didn't need a physics engine this complex. I worked pretty hard during this sprint but I think I could've progressed more. I got very caught up working on my enemies. I couldn't figure out how to get them to work how I wanted. I changed how I implemented my enemies as I previously had them as part of the tile map but decided that wasn't good enough so have put them in the same way as I did with my player character. With the enemies now in my game I have a way to lose.

I worked on my tile sets for my game and finished my enemy character design. Next sprint I will get my map looking better as I think that's where my game is lacking most at the moment. I began to work on the animation for my character and enemy. 



## **Major Changes and Achievements Described**
- enemies
- physics engine
- enemy design
- tile set progress
## **Brief Description of your testing**
- I tested which movement people liked more for each physics engine. This was done through an A/B test and letting people have a go playing with each.
- Testing out different code for enemy seek function
- Testing if my enemy was working as expected
